Description: Gibbs sampling for Bayesian spatial blind source separation (BSP-BSS). BSP-BSS is designed for spatially dependent signals in high dimensional and large-scale data, such as neuroimaging. The method assumes the expectation of the observed images as a linear mixture of multiple sparse and piece-wise smooth latent source signals, and constructs a Bayesian nonparametric prior by thresholding Gaussian processes. Details can be found in our paper: Wu et al. (2022+) "Bayesian Spatial Blind Source Separation via the Thresholded Gaussian Process" <doi:10.1080/01621459.2022.2123336>.
